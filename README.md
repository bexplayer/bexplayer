### Introducing Myself!
Hi! I'm Rebecca or Bex. I'm just a regular person who likes to code in my free time, and make things for the world to see and use! The majority of what I'll be making on here are probably just random scripts or small mods, but who knows? Thanks for taking the time to check out my profile!
### What am I working on?
I don't have any major projects right now, but I'll eventually post some stuff on [@wintervine](https://github.com/wintervine), my engineering company page.
